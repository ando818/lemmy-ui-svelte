This is a rewrite of the Lemmy UI in SvelteKit to address the number of existing issues. Contains the capacitor framework allowing a single codebase to triple as a Android and iOS native apps. This is in active development and has a lot of mess to clean up.


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
